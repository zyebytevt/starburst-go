# StarBurst, Go!

This is the streaming backend software, initially imagined to be written in DLang, now realized in Go. It mainly controls a Stream Deck, and allows for various functions that could be usable for a streamer. Everything is designed to be as modular and customizable as possible.

For details on how to use the configuration file `config.yaml`, please look at the [configuration file documentation](CONFIG.md)!
